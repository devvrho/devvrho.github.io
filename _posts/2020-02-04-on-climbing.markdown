## Hello
Turns out it's really hard to write a blog post if you've never done it before. Lately I've been playing video games, climbing at our gym, and hanging out with my girlfriend and cats. Today I spent a couple hours at Barnes and Noble getting this site up. In the coming weeks I'll post things I've learned that are software related, or updates on my climbing progress.
